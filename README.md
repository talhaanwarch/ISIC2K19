# ISIC2K19
## Background
Skin cancer is the most common cancer globally, with melanoma being the most deadly form. Dermoscopy is a skin imaging modality that has demonstrated improvement for diagnosis of skin cancer compared to unaided visual inspection. However, clinicians should receive adequate training for those improvements to be realized. In order to make expertise more widely available, the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) has developed the ISIC Archive, an international repository of dermoscopic images, for both the purposes of clinical training, and for supporting technical research toward automated algorithmic analysis by hosting the ISIC Challenges.

## Task
The goal for ISIC 2019 is classify dermoscopic images among nine different diagnostic categories:

Melanoma
Melanocytic nevus
Basal cell carcinoma
Actinic keratosis
Benign keratosis (solar lentigo / seborrheic keratosis / lichen planus-like keratosis)
Dermatofibroma
Vascular lesion
Squamous cell carcinoma
None of the others
